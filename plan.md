PLAN

- sort out the look of the page (using css and html - may be changed/revised later)
- create a text imput feild where user can input their task (i need to...)
- button - create a button that stands out and has a nice colour
- make page interactive using js - once button is clicked, task should appear on the page as a to-do list
- once task is completed, user should be able to cross out the task (makes it satifying) - moreover, if user changes their mind and no longer wants to have a particular task in their to-do list, they should be able to delete it off off their list
- fetch data from a quotes api and display a new inspiring quote each time the page is refreshed
- maybe also add digital clock too to give diary aesthetic
